# Remote Work Overview

## Making Remote Work

### Establish a Remote Leadership Team

Organize a team of people with experience working remotely to communicate remote
work best practices and answer questions for others. This team should have the
authority to establish and document company best practices and identify directly
responsible individuals (DRIs) to find solutions.

### Leverage the Company Handbook

The company handbook serves as a single source of truth for the entire company.
One of the major challenges when going remote is keeping everyone informed in an
efficient manor. Use this handbook to systematically document process changes in
a central place to minimize confusion.

### Establish a Communications Strategy

Transparency is key when transition to remote collaboration. Team members expect
frequent updates as leaders iterate on their communication plan.

### Consolidate Communication Tools

Use the fewest tools possible and eliminate tools with redundant features. Using
fewer tools means brings a unified approach to communication and eliminates
confusion around tool choice.

### Embrace Change

The transition to remote is a process and takes time. Leaders need to embrace
iteration, establish communication around what is and isn't working, and
communicate messaging to all employees. Our success comes down to trust,
communication, and company-wide support of shared goals.

## Meeting Etiquette

### Conference Rooms

Conference rooms are a limited resource. Only reserve a conference room when
it's required and immediately release reserved conference rooms if they're no
longer needed. Reserving a conference room and not using it may prevent
collaboration when it's needed most.

### Zoom Whiteboard

Leverage
[Zoom's whiteboard](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/205677665-Sharing-a-whiteboard).
Zoom's whiteboard is just as good as a conference room whiteboard and allows you
to make collaborative annotations with remote colleagues. You can save a copy of
your annotated whiteboard by exporting it to a PDF or image. These annotations
can be added to shared notes (such as a shared Google Doc) for everyone to
quickly reference.

### Video Conference Default

Always include remote colleagues in team meetings. Add a conference video link
(i.e. Zoom) as a default to your meetings so all team members can participate,
regardless of location. This has the added benefit of helping on-site colleagues
who might be working from home.

### Camera On Conferencing

When conducting a meeting with on-site and remote employees, encourage all
on-site colleagues to join the video conference from their laptops with their
camera on and microphone muted. This may seem strange at first, but having all
participants on video helps remote employees see all meeting participants and
feel like equal participants. This also helps remote colleagues keep track of
who's speaking during the meeting.

### Meeting Agendas & Notes

Meeting organizers should include an agenda with the meeting invite. The agenda
is often a shared Google Doc that all participants can edit during the
discussion. Including the link in the meeting invite makes it easy to find when
you need it.

The shared Google Doc should be used to document the discussion, decisions, and
actions made during the meeting. This doc should be editable by all participants
so participants can collaborate on notes and refer to a single source of truth.
Zoom's whiteboard can be exported and added to the document along with any other
relevant assets or resources.

This may feel like extra work at first, but this documentation minimizes
miscommunication and establishes a source of truth for future reference. This
also helps people who miss the meeting keep up to date on the discussion and
outcomes.

Your team might consider sharing all meeting notes to a shared Google Drive
folder for improved organization and reference.

### Video Conference Recordings

Video conference calls should be recorded by default. This doesn't mean every
meeting needs to be recorded (such as confidential or private discussions), but
automatically recording conference calls helps promote a culture of
documentation and transparency. These recordings can be shared with participants
for their future reference. Links to meeting recordings should be included in
the group's shared meeting notes.

You can configure Zoom to automatically record meetings so you don't have to
remember to do it each time. Zoom can record meetings in the cloud and will send
you a link to the recording after the meeting.

configure your Zoom settings for automatic cloud recording.

## Communication Tools & Techniques

### Create a Team Meeting Space

A team meeting space is dedicated, repeating meeting for your team to hold
casual discussions and impromptu meetings. This can take the form of a dedicated
Zoom meeting that's always available for your team to jump in and out of at any
time. This allows your team to quickly meet without going through the hassle of
creating a meeting and inviting attendees.

<details><summary>How to create a dedicated meeting space in Zoom</summary>

1. open your [AbSci Google Calendar](calendar.google.com)
2. Add a new meeting and set it to repeat daily for an arbitrary date range

   _Note_: Don't add a video conference option yet. We have to first close and
   save the event to get around Zoom's limit on recurring meetings.

3. Check to make sure the event successfully saved to your calendar.
4. Edit the meeting you created and click "Add video conferencing" and select
   "Zoom Meeting"
5. You now have a meeting that you can share with your team. The Zoom URL will
   remain the same so team members can bookmark the URL for quick access

### Use a Microphone

Use a headset with a microphone when talking in a noisy environment. It's a good
idea to confirm your audio input source before before joining a conference call.
