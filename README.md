# Remote Work

## Making Remote Work

### Establish a Remote Leadership Team

Organize a team of people who have experience working remotely to communicate
remote work best practices and answer questions for others. This team should
Document best practices and develop strategies to resolve challenges. This team
has the authority to establish company best practices and identify directly
responsible individuals (DRIs) to find solutions.

### Leverage the Company Handbook

The company handbook serves as a single source of truth for the entire company.
One of the major challenges when going remote is keeping everyone informed in an
efficient manor. Use this handbook to systematically document process changes in
a central place to minimize confusion.

### Establish a Communications Strategy

Transparency is key when transition to remote collaboration. Team members expect
frequent updates as leaders iterate on their communication plan

### Consolidate Communication Tools

Use the fewest tools possible and eliminate tools with redundant features. Using
fewer tools means brings a unified approach to communication and eliminates
confusion around tool choice.

### Embrace Change

The transition to remote is a process and takes time. Leaders need to embrace
iteration, establish communication around what is and isn't working, and
communicate messaging to all employees. Managing a remote company is like
managing any companyâ€”it comes down to trust, communication, and company-wide
support of shared goals.

## Meeting Etiquette

### Conference Rooms

Conference rooms are a limited resource. Only reserve a conference room when
it's required and immediately release reserved conference rooms if they're no
longer needed. Reserving a conference room and not using it may prevent
collaboration when it's needed most.

### Zoom Whiteboard

Leverage Zoom's whiteboard. Zoom's whiteboard is just as good as a conference
room whiteboard and allow you to make collaborative annotations with remote
colleagues. Zoom's whiteboard also lets you export your annotations so you can
easily share your ideas with your team.

### Video Conference Default

Always include remote colleagues in team meetings. When creating a meeting, add
a conference video link (i.e. Zoom) as a default so all team members can
participate, regardless of location. This has an added benefit of helping
on-site colleagues that might need to change plans and work from home.

### Camera On Conferencing

When conducting a meeting with on-site and remote employees, it's best to
encourage all on-site colleagues to join the video conference from their laptops
with their camera on and microphone muted. This may seem strange at first, but
having all participants on the video call helps remote employees see all meeting
participants and feel like equal participants. It also helps remote colleagues
keep track of who's speaking which might not be as clear with a single
conference room video camera.

### Meeting Agendas & Notes

Meeting organizers should include a shared Google Doc with the meeting invite.
The shared document should include a meeting agenda to communicate the purpose
and expectations of participants. An agenda helps participants prepare for a
meeting and ensures everyone knows the meeting's objectives. It also helps to
include the shared document in the meeting invite so all participants know where
to find meeting notes.

The shared Google Doc should be used to document the discussion, decisions, and
actions made during the meeting. This doc should be editable by all participants
so participants can collaborate on notes and reference a single source of truth.
Annotations made to a Zoom whiteboard can be exported from Zoom and added to the
document along with any other relevant assets or resources. This may feel like
extra work at first, but such documentation minimizes miscommunication and
establishes transparent collaboration. This also helps people who can't join the
meeting up to date on the discussion and outcomes. Your team might also consider
sharing all meeting notes to a google drive folder for improved organization and
quick access.

### Video Conference Recordings

Video conference calls should be recorded as a default. This doesn't mean every
meeting needs to be recorded (such as confidential or private discussions), but
automatically recording conference calls helps promote a culture of
documentation and transparency. These recordings can be shared with participants
for their future reference. Links to meeting recordings should be included in
the group's shared meeting notes.

Zoom can be configured to automatically record meetings so you don't have to
remember to do it each time. Zoom can also record meetings in the cloud and send
you a recording link after the meeting. This makes it easy to share recordings
and keeps you from having to manage video files yourself.

reference for how to configure your Zoom settings to automatically record
meetings in the cloud.

## Communication Tools & Techniques

### Create a Team Meeting Space

A team meeting space is dedicated, repeating meeting for your team to hold
casual discussions and impromptu meetings. This can take the form of a dedicated
Zoom meeting that's always available for your team to jump in and out of at any
time. This allows your team to quickly meet without going through the hassle of
creating a meeting and inviting attendees.

To create one with zoom:

1. open your [AbSci Google Calendar](calendar.google.com)
2. Add a new meeting and set it to repeat daily for an arbitrary date range

   _Note_: Don't add a video conference option yet. We have to first close and
   save the event to get around Zoom's limit on recurring meetings.

3. Check to make sure the event successfully saved to your calendar.
4. Edit the meeting you created and click "Add video conferencing" and select
   "Zoom Meeting"
5. You now have a meeting that you can share with your team. The Zoom URL will
   remain the same so team members can bookmark the URL for quick access

### Use a Microphone

Use a headset with a microphone when talking in a noisy environment. It's a good
idea to confirm your audio input source before before joining a conference call.
